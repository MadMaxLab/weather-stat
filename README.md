**Weather stat** 

Weather stat is my personal pet project. 
For now, it doesn't  have any complete useful functionality, but it can be seen as my code style example.

Main idea to collect weather statistic from public API and make some useful aggregations with that data.

I'll document all the api when I complete at least basic logic.
